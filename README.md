This is my "Airline Reservation System" project by using C++ to provide facilities to passengers by booking their flight tickets online. It will take details of the customer and provide the schedule of different flights of different countries like names, date, timing & also charges of flights so that user or passenger can book their tickets online and get their tickets at a time. when we will start the project it will show a wellcome page and will ask user choice like press 1 for add customer details, 2 for flight registeration, 3 for flight charges and tickets and 4 for exit. If user enter 1 it will fetch out information from customer and will save in a file.If press 2 it will show flights for different countries and ask for user choice and show information of that particular flight which user has choose then in main by pressing 3 user can get his ticket and if user press 4 he will exit from that system.
